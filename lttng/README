a. First set the lttng_provider_cnt and the lttng_max_session_cnt to appropriate values.

echo 26 > lttng_provider_cnt
echo 26 > lttng_max_session_cnt
b. Run the Gen script to generate the required TracePoint Providers.
   The gen script generates 3 files, one containing a main function generating 52 trace events
   and 2 files(.h/.c) to declare and define the trace points.

./lttng_gen.py

c. Run the Compile Script to generate the executables.

./lttng_compile.py

d. Run the run script to spawn the required processes and the sessions to trace.

./lttng_run_session_nS_1C.py

Note:
-----
In the last session creation of the channel fails, only the first 25 session/channel pairs come up.
<ErrorMsg>
Error: Event tp_25:*: UST create channel failed (channel channel0, session tp_session_25)
Error: No channel found in the session
</ErrorMsg>

e. Run the stop script to stop/destroy the sessions that were created.
   Note one has to run the appropriate stop script depending on the run script in step (d).

./lttng_stop_session_nS_1C.py
